## Overview

The KillPID.sh script simplifies process management by automating common tasks such as listing running processes, prompting the user for a PID, and safely terminating the process. It provides a looped interface, allowing users to manage multiple processes in a single session.

## **Features**

- Lists all currently running processes with detailed information.
- Allows users to specify a PID to terminate a process.
- Validates user input to ensure a valid PID is entered.
- Prompts users to continue managing processes or exit the script.
- Improves workflow efficiency by eliminating the need to manually enter commands.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux-based system with Bash shell.

- Basic Requirements:

  - The ps command (included in most Linux distributions).

  - Permissions to terminate processes (e.g., root or sudo privileges, if required).

- User Knowledge:

  - Basic understanding of processes and PIDs.

## **Usage**

- Preparation:

  - Save the script as KillPID.sh.
  - Make it executable:

    ```bash
    chmod +x KillPID.sh
    ```

- Running the Script:

  - Open a terminal and navigate to the script's location.
  - Run the script:

    ```bash
    ./KillPID.sh
    ```

- Interactive Process Management:

  - View the list of running processes.
  - Enter the PID of the process you want to terminate.
  - Confirm or retry as needed.
  - Choose whether to manage another process or exit.

## **Script Workflow**

- Process Listing:

  - Uses the ps aux command to display all running processes with details such as PID, CPU usage, memory usage, and command.

- User Interaction:

  - Prompts the user to enter a PID.
  - Validates the input to ensure itâ€™s numeric and corresponds to a running process.

- Process Termination:

  - Attempts to terminate the specified process using the kill command.
  - Displays a success or failure message.

- Looping Interface:

  - Asks the user whether they want to terminate another process.
  - Repeats the workflow until the user chooses to exit.

## **Output**

The script outputs the following details:

- Process List:

  - Displays all running processes in the terminal.

- Interactive Prompts:

  - Guides the user to input a PID and confirms the action.

- Result Messages:

  - Success: Process [PID] has been terminated.
  - Failure: Failed to terminate process [PID]. Check permissions or PID validity.

## **Compatibility**

- Operating Systems:
  - Linux distributions with Bash (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora).

- Dependencies:
  - ***ps***, ***kill***, and standard Bash commands.

- Permission Requirements:
  - Sudo or root access may be required to terminate processes owned by other users.


## Notes

- Caution:

  - Terminating critical system processes can lead to system instability or crashes.

- Validation:

  - The script includes basic input validation to reduce errors.

- Security:

  - Ensure you run the script only on trusted systems with appropriate permissions.
