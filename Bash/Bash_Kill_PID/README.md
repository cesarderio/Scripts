# Loops Bash Script

This script is designed to interactively list running processes, prompt the user to specify a Process ID (PID), and then terminate the process associated with that PID.

## Overview

The `KillPID.sh` script provides a user-friendly interface for managing system processes. It automates the following tasks:

1. Displays all currently running processes.
2. Prompts the user to enter the PID of the process they wish to terminate.
3. Terminates the specified process.
4. Offers the user an option to repeat the process or exit the script.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux-based system.
- Basic understanding of process management and PIDs.
- Appropriate permissions to terminate processes on the system.

## Usage

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `KillPID.sh` script.
3. Give execute permissions to the script: `chmod +x KillPID.sh`.
4. Run the script: `./KillPID.sh`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to specify a PID and manage processes.

## Steps

1. The script starts by displaying a list of all running processes using the `ps aux` command.
2. The user is prompted to enter the PID of the process they wish to terminate.
3. The script verifies the PID and, if valid, terminates the specified process.
4. The user is then asked whether they wish to kill another process or exit the script.

## Notes

- Ensure you understand the implications of terminating a process, as it can affect system stability or data integrity.
- Running this script with administrative privileges may be required to terminate certain processes.
- The script includes basic validation to check for valid PID entries.
- It's important to enter only PIDs of processes that you are sure should be terminated, as terminating essential system processes can lead to system instability.
- The script is designed to be user-friendly and allows multiple attempts at terminating processes, enhancing its utility in process management scenarios.
