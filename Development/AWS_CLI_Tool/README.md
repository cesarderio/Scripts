## **Script Workflow**

1. AWS SDK Initialization: Initializes Boto3 to interface with AWS services.

1. Interactive Menu: Prompts the user with a menu of AWS service categories.

1. Service Selection: Upon selecting a service, the script fetches and displays resource data based on the chosen option.

1. Error Handling: If the script encounters any issues (e.g., missing credentials or permission errors), it will provide informative messages to guide troubleshooting.

1. Exit: The user can exit the program at any time by selecting the quit option.

## **Output**

- Resource Lists: The script will list resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS instances, etc., based on user selection.

- Error Messages: If there are issues (e.g., missing permissions), the script will display specific error messages to assist in diagnosing and resolving problems.

- Interactive Prompts: The tool uses an interactive CLI interface to guide users through AWS resource management tasks.

## **Compatibility**

- Supported Systems: This script is compatible with systems running Python 3.x and Boto3.

- Dependencies: Requires an active internet connection and AWS credentials configured.

- AWS Region: The script uses the default AWS region set in your AWS credentials or environment variables.

## **Notes**
